Make a class that implements a method that reads a list of marks betw een 0 and 100 from the user, one per line, and stops when the user introduces a -1. The program should outp ut at the end (and only at the end) how many marks there were in total, how many were distinctions (70–100), ho w many were passes (50–69), how many failed (0–49), and how many were invalid (e.g. 150 or -3). Use readLine() exactly once . The output may look similar to this example
